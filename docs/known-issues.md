## Room code exhaustion

Room codes are 4 random uppercase letters (e.g. `XKQZ`), giving 26⁴ = 456,976 possible codes. If rooms are not cleaned up promptly after games end, the pool will eventually fill up and new rooms cannot be created.

**Fix options:**
- Periodically expire and free codes from finished/abandoned rooms
- Expand to 5-letter codes (26⁵ ≈ 11.8M) or add digits (36⁴ ≈ 1.7M)
